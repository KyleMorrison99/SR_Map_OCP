abstract={The relation between pesticides exposure and metabolic syndrome (MetS) has not been clearly identified. Performing a systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and ScienceDirect were searched for studies reporting the risk of MetS following pesticides exposure and their contaminants. We included 12 studies for a total of 6789 participants, in which 1981 (29.1%) had a MetS. Overall exposure to pesticides and their contaminants increased the risk of MetS by 30% (95CI 22%–37%). Overall organochlorine increased the risk of MetS by 23% (14–32%), as well as for most types of organochlorines: hexachlorocyclohexane increased the risk by 53% (28–78%), hexachlorobenzene by 40% (0.01–80%), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene by 22% (9–34%), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane by 28% (5–50%), oxychlordane by 24% (1–47%), and transnonchlor by 35% (19–52%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed that overall exposure to pesticides and their contaminants increased the risk by 46% (35–56%) using crude data or by 19% (10–29%) using fully-adjusted model. The risk for overall pesticides and types of pesticides was also significant with crude data but only for hexachlorocyclohexane (36% risk increase, 17–55%) and transnonchlor (25% risk increase, 3–48%) with fully-adjusted models. Metaregressions demonstrated that hexachlorocyclohexane increased the risk of MetS in comparison to most other pesticides. The risk increased for more recent periods (Coefficient = 0.28, 95CI 0.20 to 0.37, by year). We demonstrated an inverse relationship with body mass index and male gender. In conclusion, pesticides exposure is a major risk factor for MetS. Besides organochlorine exposure, data are lacking for other types of pesticides. The risk increased with time, reflecting a probable increase of the use of pesticides worldwide. The inverse relationship with body mass index may signify a stockage of pesticides and contaminants in fat tissue. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We have performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between DDT/DDE and diabetes, searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane for relevant articles published up to August 30, 2021, and eventually including 43 publications. Our researchers evaluate included studies’ quality and risk of bias via the recommended tool. This study uses meta-analyses of random effects of each exposure and outcome to estimate combined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our research identified 43 cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies, including 40,141 individuals in America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The summary ORs (95% CIs) of incident diabetes were 1.61 (1.10–2.39) for DDT, 1.67 (1.41–1.98) for DDE. The subgroup analysis indicated that the association is significantly higher in the region of Asia for both DDT (OR = 2.73) and DDE (OR = 2.62). Besides, we also tried various types of stratification to identify the more influential confounding factors, among which regional factors have a significant influence. Study evidence suggests that exposure to DDT and its breakdown product, DDE, might be associated with the risk of incident diabetes. Among Asian patients, DDT/DDE concentrations are more closely associated with diabetes. Further studies in specific regions will be considered in the future. © 2022},

abstract={Insect-borne diseases, such as malaria, and plant pathogens, like the tobacco mosaic virus, are responsible for human deaths and poor crop yields in communities around the world. The use of insecticides has been one of the major tools in pest control. However, the development of insecticide resistance has been a major problem in the control of insect pest populations that threaten the health of both humans and plants. The overexpression of detoxification genes is thought to be one of the major mechanisms through which pests develop resistance to insecticides. Hundreds of research papers have explored how overexpressed detoxification genes increase the resistance status of insects to an insecticide in recent years. This study is, for the first time, a synthesis of these resistance and gene expression data aimed at (1) setting up an example for the application of meta-analysis in the investigation of the mechanisms of insecticide resistance and (2) seeking to determine if the overexpression detoxification genes are responsible for insecticide resistance in insect pests in general. A strong correlation of increased levels of insecticide resistance has been observed in tested insects with cytochrome P450 (CYP), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and esterase gene superfamilies, confirming that the overexpression of detoxification genes is indeed involved in the insecticide resistance through the increased metabolism of insecticides of insects, including medically (e.g., mosquito and housefly) and agriculturally (e.g., planthopper and caterpillar) important insects.

abstract={Pesticides reach aquatic ecosystems and interact with various targets in cells of fish and other living organisms. Toxicity originates during the metabolization process, which may produce toxic metabolites or reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) indicate toxicants interacted with drug-metabolizing and antioxidant systems, i.e., they are biomarkers of biotransformation and oxidative stress. We meta-analytically quantified the impact of pesticides on the mean response and variability of these biomarkers. Our goals were to verify (i) the overall effect of pesticides on oxidative stress and biotransformation, and how each biomarker respond to exposure; (ii) how the life stage of fish (juvenile and adult) influence biomarkers variability and mean activity; (iii) to what extent fish sex (male, female or mixed-sex groups) modify pesticides toxicity; (iv) how different classes of pesticides, and the combination of their concentration and time of exposure, affect each biomarker. Overall, pesticides induced oxidative stress and the biotransformation system. Regardless of life stage, EROD mean activity increased significantly. In exposed juveniles, CAT and GST variability decreased and increased, respectively. CAT mean activity was higher in females, while EROD and GST activities increased in males after pesticide exposure. Organophosphorus (OPs) and organochlorine insecticides, along with imidazole and triazole fungicides, affected biomarkers the most, however the combined effect of concentration and time of exposure of OPs was not detected. Notably, imidazoles and triazoles classes increased EROD by more than 100%. Additionally, we identified research gaps, such as the lack of effect estimates of relevant pesticides on EROD (e.g., pyrethroids and neonicotinoids) and the small number of studies evaluating GSH on female fish. Future researchers may use these gaps as a guide towards enhanced experimental designs and, consequently, a better understanding of pesticide toxic effects on fish. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Thyroid hormone homeostasis is essential for normal brain development in fetuses and infants. Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy is associated with compromised maternal thyroid homeostasis, and thus may lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborns. However, evidence regarding the association of prenatal EDC exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between maternal exposure to EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies that provided quantitative data on the association between prenatal EDC exposure and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in August 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted β regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. The pooling results indicated that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence on neonatal TSH, TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in the specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal exposure to organochlorine (β coefficient, −0.022; 95% CI, −0.04 to −0.003) and PFAS (β coefficient, −0.017; 95% CI, −0.033 to 0) was negatively associated with neonatal TT4 level. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to organochlorine and PFAS may be associated with lower neonatal TT4 level. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Objective. This study explored the systematic evaluation and meta-analysis of different concentrations of PCP on the risk of long-term bradycardia in fetuses. Methods. Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, China Biomedical Literature Service, CNCNKI, and Wanfang database were computerized to collect all case-control studies on the association between variety classes and different concentrations of environmental pollutant gas to fetal of prolonged bradycardia. After evaluating the quality of the inclusion study and extracting valid data, meta-analysis was performed using Stata15 software. Relative hazards were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method and the random effect model, and P values and I2 values were used for heterogeneity evaluation. When heterogeneity occurs, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to explore the sources. Results. A total of 15 studies were included, including 1202 patients with fetal of prolonged bradycardia and 1380 in the control population. Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference in PCP < 0.1 mg/L between the experimental group and control group (OR = 1.03, 95% CI (0.62, 1.72), P=0.90, I2 = 0%, Z = 0.13), but there was a statistical difference in PCP > 5 mg/L (OR = 1.73, 95% CI (1.15, 2.58), P=0.008, I2 = 0%, Z = 2.65), PCP > 10 mg/L (OR = 1.75, 95% CI (1.19, 2.57), P=0.004, I2 = 14%, Z = 2.85), and PCP >15 mg/L (OR = 2.02, 95% CI (1.38, 2.95), P=0.0003, I2 = 77%, Z = 3.61). Conclusion. In this study, we found that different concentrations of PCP increased the risk of long-term bradycardia in fetuses, and the risk coefficient increased with the increase of PCP concentration. © 2022 Xueyun Song and Xiaodong Fu.},

abstract={Background: The incidence of respiratory disease is increasing. In relation to this, in addition to infection, factors associated with working with chemical insecticides are a cause for concern. Some of the chemicals involved have been shown to affect the respiratory system, and consequentially workers are at increased risk of conditions such as asthma. However, medical opinion around this area is still controversial; therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the association between exposure to insecticides and asthma by means of a systematic review of the relevant literature. Methods: Relevant literature was identified, and a systematic review was conducted to investigate the association between exposure to insecticides and asthma. Results: A total of five studies (three cross sectional and two cohort) including 45,435 subjects were identified as relevant. The summary odds ratios related to the impact of exposure to specific insecticides on asthma were organophosphates 1.31 (95% CI = 1.17–1.48, I2 = 27%, p = 0.172), carbamates 1.44 (95% CI 1.08–1.92, I2 = 56.7%, p = 0.031) and organochlorines 1.31 (95% CI 1.19–1.64, I2 = 37.3%, p = 0.131). Conclusion: Farmers exposed to certain insecticides may have an increased risk of asthma and asthmatic symptoms, but further research on that issue is urgently needed. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Purpose: Endocrine-related diseases and disorders are on the rise globally. Synthetically produced environmental chemicals (endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs)) mimic hormones like oestrogen and alter signalling pathways. Endometriosis is an oestrogen-dependent condition, affecting 10-15% of women of the reproductive age, and has substantial impacts on the quality of life. The aetiology of endometriosis is believed to be multifactorial, ranging from genetic causes to immunologic dysfunction due to environmental exposure to EDCs. Hence, we undertook a systematic review and investigated the epidemiological evidence for an association between EDCs and the development of endometriosis. We also aimed to assess studies on the relationship between body concentration of EDCs and the severity of endometriosis. Method: Following PRISMA guidelines, a structured search of PubMed, Embase and Scopus was conducted (to July 2018). The included studies analysed the association between one or more EDCs and the prevalence of endometriosis. The types of EDCs, association and outcome, participant characteristics and confounding variables were extracted and analysed. Quality assessment was performed using standard criteria. Results: In total, 29 studies were included. Phthalate esters were positively associated with the prevalence of endometriosis. The majority (71%) of studies revealed a significant association between bisphenol A, organochlorinated environmental pollutants (dioxins, dioxin-like compounds, organochlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls) and the prevalence of endometriosis. A positive association between copper, chromium and prevalence of endometriosis was demonstrated in one study only. Cadmium, lead and mercury were not associated with the prevalence of endometriosis. There were conflicting results for the association between nickel and endometriosis. The relationship of EDCs and severity of endometriosis was not established in the studies. Conclusion: We found some evidence to suggest an association between phthalate esters, bisphenol A, organochlorinated environmental pollutants and the prevalence of endometriosis. Disentangling these exposures from various other factors that affect endometriosis is complex, but an important topic for further research. © 2021 De Gruyter. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: The insecticides used widely has led to resistance in the vector and impose a challenge to vector control op-eration. Objectives: This review aims to analyse the distribution of insecticide resistance of dengue vectors in South East Asia and to describe the mechanism of insecticide resistance. Methods: Literature search for articles published on 2015 to 2019 from PubMed, Scopus and ProQuest was performed. Total of 37 studies included in the final review from the initial 420 studies. Results: Pyrethroid resistance was concentrated on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia and Northern Thailand and scattered at Java Island, Indonesia while organophosphate resistance was seen across the Java Island (Indonesia), West Sumatera and North Peninsular Malaysia. Organochlorine resistance was seen in Sabah, Malaysia and scattered distribution in Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. V1016G, S989P, F1269C gene mutation in Aedes Aegypti were associated with Pyrethroid resistance in Singapore and Indonesia. In Malaysia, over-expressed with monooxygenase P450 genes (CYP9J27, CYP6CB1, CYP9J26 and CYP9M4) Glutathione S-transferases, carboxylesterases commonly associated with pyrethroids resistance in Aedes Aegypti and CYP612 overexpressed in Aedes Albopictus. The genetic mutation in A302S in Aedes Albopictus was associated with organochlorine resistance in Malaysia. Conclusions: Rotation of insecticide, integration with synergist and routine assessment of resistance profile are recom-mended strategies in insecticide resistance management. © 2021 Hassan MR et al.},

abstract={Persistent halogenated organic pollutants (HOPs) are a class of toxic chemicals, which may have adverse effects on fetuses via transplacental transfer from their mothers. Here, we review reported internal exposure levels of various HOPs (organochlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, short- and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) in placenta, and both maternal and umbilical cord sera. We also present analyses of the transplacental transfer and placental distribution characteristics of each class of compounds, and discuss effects of several factors on the transfer and accumulation efficiencies of HOPs, as well as the main mechanisms of HOPs’ transfer across the placental barrier. Reported compound-specific transplacental transfer efficiencies and distribution efficiencies, expressed as umbilical cord:maternal serum and placental:maternal serum concentration ratios (RCM and RPM, respectively), are summarized. Average published RCM values of the HOPs range from 0.24 to 3.08 (lipid-adjusted) and from 0.04 to 3.1 (based on wet weights), and are highest for perfluoroalkylcarboxylates (PFCAs) and tetrabromobisphenol A. Average published RPM values range from 0.14 to 1.02 (lipid-adjusted) and from 0.30 to 1.4 (based on wet weights). The broad RCM and RPM ranges may reflect effects of various factors, inter alia physicochemical properties of HOPs, metabolic capacities of mothers and fetuses, placental maturity, and differential expression of influx/efflux transporters in the placenta. Generally, HOPs’ RCM values decline linearly with molecular size, and are curvilinearly related to solubility. Plasma protein binding affinity and the difference between maternal and fetal metabolic capacities may also affect some HOPs’ transfer efficiencies. HOPs’ molecular size may be influential. Transplacental transport of HOPs likely occurs mostly through passive diffusion, although influx/efflux transporters expressed on maternal and/or fetal sides of the placenta may also facilitate or hinder their transport. Overall, the review highlights clear gaps in our understanding of mechanisms involved in HOPs’ transplacental transport. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Insecticide use has been linked to increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), however, findings of epidemiologic studies have been inconsistent, particularly for NHL subtypes. We analyzed 1690 NHL cases and 5131 controls in the North American Pooled Project (NAPP) to investigate self-reported insecticide use and risk of NHL overall and by subtypes: follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals for each insecticide were estimated using logistic regression. Subtype-specific associations were evaluated using ASSET (Association analysis for SubSETs). Increased risks of multiple NHL subtypes were observed for lindane (OR = 1.60, 1.20-2.10: FL, DLCBL, SLL), chlordane (OR = 1.59, 1.17-2.16: FL, SLL) and DDT (OR = 1.36, 1.06-1.73: DLBCL, SLL). Positive trends were observed, within the subsets with identified associations, for increasing categories of exposure duration for lindane (Ptrend = 1.7 × 10−4), chlordane (Ptrend = 1.0 × 10−3) and DDT (Ptrend = 4.2 × 10−3), however, the exposure-response relationship was nonlinear. Ever use of pyrethrum was associated with an increased risk of FL (OR = 3.65, 1.45-9.15), and the relationship with duration of use appeared monotonic (OR for &gt;10 years: OR = 5.38, 1.75-16.53; Ptrend = 3.6 × 10−3). Our analysis identified several novel associations between insecticide use and specific NHL subtypes, suggesting possible etiologic heterogeneity in the context of pesticide exposure. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Background: Except for known cardiovascular risk factors, long-term exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs) – a class of exogenous chemicals, or a mixture of chemicals, that can interfere with any aspect of hormone action – has been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are still controversial. Objective: To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the association between EEDs, including nonylphenol (NP), bisphenol A (BPA), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), organo-chlorine pesticide (OCP) and phthalate (PAE) exposure and CVD risk. Methods: The heterogeneity between different studies was qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated using Q test and I2 statistical magnitude, respectively. Subgroup analysis was performed using chemical homologs – a previously unused grouping method – to extract data and perform meta-analysis to assess their exposure to CVD. Results: Twenty-nine literatures were enrolled with a total sample size of 88891. The results indicated that exposure to PCB138 and PCB153 were the risk factors for CVD morbidity (odds ratio (OR) = 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10–1.66; OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.13–1.62). Exposure to organo-chlorine pesticide (OCP) (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.00–1.24), as well as with phthalate (PAE) (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06–1.17) and BPA (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03–1.37) were positively associated with CVD risk, respectively. BPA exposure concentration had no correlation with total cholesterol (TC), or low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but exhibited a correlation with gender, waist circumference (WC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), age, and body mass index (BMI) (standardized mean difference (SMD)) = 1.51; 95% CI: =(1.01–2.25); SMD = 0.16; 95% CI: (0.08–0.23); SMD = −0.19; 95% CI: (−0.27–0.12); SMD = −0.78; 95% CI: (−1.42–0.14); SMD = 0.08; 95% CI: (0.00–0.16). Conclusions: EED exposure is a risk factor for CVD. Long-term exposure to EEDs can influence cardiovascular health in humans. A possible synergistic effect may exist between the homologs. The mechanism of which needs to be further explored and demonstrated by additional prospective cohort studies, results of in vitro and in vivo analyses, as well as indices affecting CVD. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are relevant families of persistent organic pollutants, which have been linked to several long-term adverse health effects. The mechanisms of action of these pollutants are still poorly understood. However, there are some evidences suggesting that inflammation might play a key role on their effects. Aim: To systematically synthesize the published in vitro, in vivo and epidemiological data assessing the potential influence of exposure to OCPs and PCBs on the development of an inflammatory milieu. Methods: A systematic review of peer-reviewed original research papers published until 1st May 2019 was conducted, by using Medline, Web of Science and Scopus databases. A total of 39 articles met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated in this review. Results: The majority of the studies showed significant associations of PCB and OCP exposure with all inflammatory markers measured (n = 30). Some studies showed positive and negative associations (n = 7) and only two studies evidenced negative associations (n = 2). Most of the available evidences came from in vitro and in vivo studies (n = 31), with few epidemiological studies (n = 8). Conclusions: We found consistent positive associations between exposure to PCBs and OCPs and the development of a pro-inflammatory milieu, with only few discrepancies. However, given the limited epidemiological evidence found, our results warrant further research in order to elucidate the real contribution of these pollutants on the inflammatory processes and subsequent diseases. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objective Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are viewed as a major potential link between the environment and obesity development. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the association between exposure to EDCs and obesity. Data sources, design and eligibility criteria PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched from inception to 6 June 2018 for studies primarily addressing the association between exposure to EDCs after the age of 2 years and anthropometric measures of obesity or body fat. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias. Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers screened and conducted data extraction and synthesis. A third reviewer resolved disagreements. Results A total of 73 studies investigating bisphenol A (32 286 individuals), organochlorine compounds (34 567 individuals), phthalates (21 401 individuals), polybrominated biphenyls (2937 individuals), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (5174 individuals), parabens (4097 individuals), benzoic acid (3671 individuals) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (349 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. Most had a cross-sectional design and low or medium risk of bias. In qualitative analysis, bisphenol A and phthalates were consistently associated with general and abdominal obesity, in children and adults, and some studies suggested this association was age-dependent and gender-dependent. Meta-analysis indicated a significant association between exposure to bisphenol A and overweight (OR 1.254, 95% CI 1.005 to 1.564), obesity (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.273 to 1.774) and increased waist circumference (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.267 to 1.783) in adults, and between exposure to 2,5-dichlorophenol and obesity in children (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1018 to 3.184). Conclusion Most observational studies supported a positive association between obesity and exposure to EDCs. Although causality cannot be determined from these data, they underscore the need to limit human exposure to EDCs in light of the evidence from animal and cell-based studies indicating the effects of these chemicals on adiposity.

abstract={Assessing long-term health effects from a potentially harmful environment is challenging. Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) have become omnipresent in our environment. Individuals may or may not experience clinical health issues from being exposed to the increasing environmental pollution in daily life, but an issue of high concern is that also the non-exposed progeny may encounter consequences of these ancestral exposures. Progress in understanding epigenetic mechanisms opens new perspectives to estimate the risk of man-made EDCs. However, the field of epigenetic toxicology is new and its application in public health or in the understanding of disease etiology is almost non-existent, especially if it concerns future generations. In this review, we investigate the literature on transgenerational inheritance of diseases, published in the past 10 years. We question whether persistent epigenetic changes occur in the male germ line after exposure to synthesized EDCs. Our systematic search led to an inclusion of 43 articles, exploring the effects of commonly used synthetic EDCs, such as plasticizers (phthalates and bisphenol A), pesticides (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, atrazine, vinclozin, methoxychlor), dioxins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, such as benzo(a)pyrene). Most studies found transgenerational epigenetic effects, often linked to puberty- or adult-onset diseases, such as testicular or prostate abnormalities, metabolic disorders, behavioral anomalies, and tumor development. The affected epigenetic mechanisms included changes in DNA methylation patterns, transcriptome, and expression of DNA methyltransferases. Studies involved experiments in animal models and none were based on human data. In the future, human studies are needed to confirm animal findings. If not transgenerational, at least intergenerational human studies and studies on EDC-induced epigenetic effects on germ cells could help to understand early processes of inheritance. Next, toxicity tests of new chemicals need a more comprehensive approach before they are introduced on the market. We further point to the relevance of epigenetic toxicity tests in regard to public health of the current population but also of future generations. Finally, this review sheds a light on how the interplay of genetics and epigenetics may explain the current knowledge gap on transgenerational inheritance. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={Anti-androgenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can cross the placenta to modify early offspring sexual dimorphic markers. These changes are linked to anogenital distance (AGD), which is an androgen-sensitive anthropometric parameter used as a biomarker of perineal growth and caudal migration of the genital tubercle. This review aimed to summarize strength of evidence for associations of in utero exposure to EDCs with AGD and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature so as to inform future research. We performed an electronic search of English literature in September 2019 in medical literature analysis and retrieval system online (MEDLINE), Web of Science and Toxline. We included epidemiological studies that examined in utero exposure to persistent and nonpersistent EDCs and considered AGD in offspring as an outcome. Our review contained 16 investigations examining exposure to persistent EDCs (nine studies) and nonpersistent EDCs (seven studies). Some individual studies reported an inverse association between exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), dioxins, perfluoroalkyl substances, and organochlorides and AGD in both male and female offspring. Meta-analysis of three studies found a small reduction of AGD in female offspring exposed to BPA. The number of studies per chemical is small, and number of subjects examined is limited; so, replication of these results is needed. To achieve more specificity and better replication of results, future studies should establish the association of nonpersistent EDCs using multiple urine samples, evaluate the cumulative impact of exposure to a mixture of anti-androgenic chemicals, and offer adequate consideration of more maternal- and children-related confounding factors. © 2019 The Author(s).

abstract={Maternal transfer of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) confronts developing embryos with a pollution legacy and poses conservation concerns due to its potential impacts unto subsequent generations. We conducted a systematic review focusing on: 1) processes of POP maternal transfer, 2) challenges and opportunities to synthesizing current knowledge on POP concentrations in eggs, and 3) a meta-analysis of patterns in current egg pollution data. Results suggest selective maternal transfer of individual compounds. These relate to biological factors such as the foraging and remigration behavior, and to the selective mobilization of POPs during vitellogenesis, such as increased diffusion limitation for lipophilic POPs and slower release and higher reabsorption of apolar POPs. A key gap relates to knowledge of further selective toxicokinetics during embryonic development, as research to date has mainly focused on initial uptake into eggs. Challenges in the synthesis of current data on egg contamination profiles relate to methodological differences, varying analytical approaches, restricted data access, and reporting transparency among studies. To increase opportunities in the use of current data, we propose best practice guidelines, and synthesize a database on POP concentrations within sea turtle eggs. The meta-analysis revealed a geographical and taxonomic bias on the West Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, with most studies conducted on green turtles. Concentrations of POPs show temporal patterns related to trends in usage, production, release, and persistence in the environment, often with regional patterns. The trophic level has the potential to influence POP patterns with higher concentrations in loggerheads compared to other species, but this is confounded by temporal and geographic trends. We argue for more mechanistically process-focused and methodologically comparable research. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;39:9–29. © 2019 SETAC. © 2019 SETAC},

abstract={Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are suspected to be associated with endometriosis (EMs). This study aimed to synthesize published data and evaluate the relationship between four classic EDCs exposure and the risk of EMs. A systematic literature search for original peer reviewed papers was performed in the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science based on inclusion criteria up to January 2018. Subsequently, a total of 20 papers conducting 30 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in this meta-analysis (four studies for bisphenol A (BPA), 12 studies for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), eight studies for organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and six studies for phthalate esters (PAEs)). The overall odds ratio (OR) across all exposures and EMs was 1.41 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23–1.60). When assessing four specific chemicals, respectively, consistent increases in the risk of EMs were found in PCBs group (OR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.18–2.12), OCPs group (OR = 1.40; 95% CI: 1.02–1.92) and PAEs group (OR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.00–1.60), while BPA showed no significant association with EMs. Besides, in the di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) group–the most commonly used PAEs, significant risk was also found (OR = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.19–1.70). The current meta-analysis strengthens the evidence that specific EDCs or their metabolites may promote the occurrence of EMs. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Background: Endometriosis is a gynaecological disease characterized by the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue that affects women during their reproductive years, having a strong impact on their lives, fertility and healthcare costs. The aetiology remains largely unknown, but current evidence suggests that it is multi-causal and oestrogen-dependent. Many epidemiologic studies have explored associations between organochlorine chemicals (OCCs) and endometriosis, but the findings are inconsistent. Objectives: A systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis were conducted to gather and synthesize all the available evidence from human epidemiological studies about the associations between OCCs and endometriosis. Data sources: The searches were conducted in PubMed and Web of Science in June 2016 with a final follow-up in August 2018. Study eligibility criteria: Only human epidemiological studies were considered, independent of participant age, body mass index or life-stage. Studies reporting individual measures of exposure to OCCs were included, considering but not limited to polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), or organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). The primary health outcome was presence of endometriosis, including all sub-types. Eligibility criteria excluded articles not written in English, conference papers, reviews and studies with overlapping information. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: A SR protocol pre-registered at PROSPERO was applied in duplicate to gather and extract all eligible original papers from PUBMED and Web of Science databases. Odds ratios were pooled using the inverse variance method for random effects meta-analysis for each group of OCCs. Risk of bias was assessed using the National Toxicology Program/Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP/OHAT) Risk of Bias Rating Tool for Human and Animal Studies adapted to the review question. The confidence in the body of evidence and related level of evidence was measured by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) based NTP/OHAT framework. The results were structured and presented in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: Of the 51 studies retained for the full-text screening, 17 provided effect sizes and metrics sufficient for pooling estimates through meta-analysis. The overall odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 1.65 (1.14; 2.39) for dioxins (n = 10), 1.70 (1.20; 2.39) for PCBs (n = 9), and 1.23 (1.13; 1.36) for OCPs (n = 5). Despite being statistically significant, these estimates should be considered with caution given the notable heterogeneity and small estimated effect size. Misclassification of exposure, due to varying laboratory detection rate capabilities, and disease status, due to varying definitions of endometriosis, were identified as major sources of uncertainty. Limitations, conclusions, and implications of key findings: The level of evidence was considered to be “moderate” with “serious” risk of bias according the NTP/OHAT criteria, supporting the need for further well-designed epidemiological research to fill lingering data gaps. Given the complexity of endometriosis and lack of known biomarkers suitable for population-based research, carefully designed observational studies play an important role in better understanding the aetiology of endometriosis, as will evolving mixture modeling approaches capable of handling various environmental chemical exposures. Attention to critical windows of exposure will shed further light on the possible developmental origin of endometriosis. Considering the high economic and societal cost associated with endometriosis, further research on this field is urged. Systematic review registration number: CRD42018080956 © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Over half of the people with diabetes in the world live in Asia. Emerging scientific evidence suggests that diabetes is associated with environmental pollutants, exposures that are also abundant in Asia. Objective: To systematically review the literature concerning the association of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and non-persistent pesticides with diabetes and diabetes-related health outcomes in Asia. Methods: PubMed and Embase were searched to identify studies published up to November 2014. A secondary reference review of all extracted articles and the National Toxicology Program Workshop on the association of POPs with diabetes was also conducted. A total of 19 articles met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated in this review. Results: To date, the evidence relating POPs and non-persistent pesticides with diabetes in Asian populations is equivocal. Positive associations were reported between serum concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and several organochlorine pesticides (DDT, DDE, oxychlordane, trans-nonachlor, hexachlorobenzene, hexachlorocyclohexane) with diabetes. PCDD/Fs were also associated with blood glucose and insulin resistance, but not beta-cell function. There were substantial limitations of the literature including: most studies were cross-sectional, few studies addressed selection bias and confounding, and most effect estimates had exceptionally wide confidence intervals. Few studies evaluated the effects of organophosphates. Conclusions: Well-conducted research is urgently needed on these pervasive exposures to inform policies to mitigate the diabetes epidemic in Asia. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Objectives: This study extended and updated a meta-analysis of the association between exposure to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and the risk of breast cancer. Methods: We reviewed the published literature on exposure to DDE and breast cancer risk to update a meta-analysis from 2004. The total of 35 studies included 16 hospital-based case-control studies, 11 population-based case-control studies, and 10 nested case-control studies identified through keyword searches in the PubMed and EMBASE databases. Results: The summary odds ratio (OR) for the identified studies was 1.03 (95% confidence interval 0.95-1.12) and the overall heterogeneity in the OR was observed (I2 = 40.9; p = 0.006). Subgroup meta-analyses indicated no significant association between exposure to DDE and breast cancer risk by the type of design, study years, biological specimen, and geographical region of the study, except from population-based case-control studies with estimated DDE levels in serum published in 1990s. Conclusion: Existing studies do not support the view that DDE increases the risk of breast cancer in humans. However, further studies incorporating more detailed information on DDT exposure and other potential risk factors for breast cancer are needed. © 2014.},

abstract={Zebrafish developmental toxicity testing is an emerging field, which faces considerable challenges regarding data meta-analysis and the establishment of standardized test protocols. Here, we present an initial correlation study on toxicity of 133 chemicals based on data in the literature to ascertain predictive developmental toxicity endpoints. We found that the physical properties of chemicals (BCF or log. P) did not fully predict lethality or developmental outcomes. Instead, individual outcomes such as pericardial edema and yolk sac edema were more reliable indicators of developmental toxicity. In addition, we ranked the chemicals based on toxicity with the Toxicological Priority Index (ToxPi) program and via a teratogenic ratio, and found that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) had the highest ToxPi score, triphenyltin acetate had the highest average ToxPi score (corrected for missing data and having more than 4 outcomes), and N-methyl-dithiocarbamate had the highest teratogenic ratio. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Preterm birth is a significant public health concern, as it is associated with high risk of infant mortality, various morbidities in both the neonatal period and later in life, and a significant societal economic burden. As many cases are of unknown etiology, identification of the contribution of environmental contaminant exposures is a priority in the study of preterm birth. This is a comprehensive review of all known studies published from 1992 through August 2012 linking maternal exposure to environmental chemicals during pregnancy with preterm birth. Using PubMed searches, studies were identified that examined associations between preterm birth and exposure to five categories of environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants, drinking-water contaminants, atmospheric pollutants, metals and metalloids, and other environmental contaminants. Individual studies were summarized and specific suggestions were made for future work in regard to exposure and outcome assessment methods as well as study design, with the recommendation of focusing on potential mediating toxicological mechanisms. In conclusion, no consistent evidence was found for positive associations between individual chemical exposures and preterm birth. By identifying limitations and addressing the gaps that may have impeded the ability to identify true associations thus far, this review can guide future epidemiologic studies of environmental exposures and preterm birth. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are synthetic chlorinated hydrocarbons that have extensively polluted the environment and bioaccumulated in the food chain. PCBs have been deemed to be probable carcinogens by the Environmental Protection Agency, and exposure to high levels of PCBs has been consistently linked to increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In the present article we present a forensic epidemiologic evaluation of the causal relationship between NHL and elevated PCB levels via application of the Bradford-Hill criteria. Included in the evaluation is a meta-analysis of the results of previously published case-control studies in order to assess the strength of association between NHL and PCBs, resulting in an odds ratio in which the lowest percentile PCB concentration (quartile, quintile, or tertile) has been compared with the highest percentile concentration in the study groups. The weight-adjusted odds ratio for all PCB congeners was 1.43 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.31 to 1.55, indicating a statistically significant causal association with NHL. Because of the lack of an unexposed comparison group, a rationale for the use of a less than 2.0 relative risk causal contribution threshold is presented herein, including an ecologic analysis of NHL incidence and PCB accumulation (as measured by sales volume) over time. The overall results presented here indicate a strong general causal association between NHL and PCB exposure. Copyright © 2012 Michael D. Freeman and Sean S. Kohles.},

abstract={Relatively recent discoveries of the hormone disrupting properties of some pesticides have raised interest in how contemporary pesticide exposures, which primarily take the form of low level environmental or occupational exposures, impact spermatogenesis. The objective of the present review was to summarize results to date of studies examining pesticide effects on human sperm. Outcomes evaluated included sperm parameters, DNA damage and numerical chromosome aberrations (aneuploidy (disomy, nullisomy) or diploidy). Studies investigating sperm in men environmentally and/or occupationally exposed to any types of pesticides were included in the review. The targeted literature search over the last 15 years showed a range of pesticide classes have been investigated including pyrethroids, organophosphates, phenoxyacetic acids, carbamates, organochlorines and pesticide mixtures. None of the studies involved acute exposure events such as chemical accidents. There were 20 studies evaluating semen quality, of which 13 studies reported an association between exposure and semen quality; 6 studies evaluating DNA damage, of which 3 reported an association with exposure; and 6 studies assessing sperm aneuploidy or diploidy, of which 4 reported an association with exposure. Studies varied widely in methods, exposures and outcomes. Although suggestive for semen parameters, the epidemiologic evidence accumulated thus far remains equivocal as to the spermatotoxic and aneugenic potential of pesticides given the small number of published studies. This question warrants more investigation and suggestions for future studies are outlined. © The Author 2008.

abstract={A search of the published and unpublished literature was conducted for analytical data on organochlorine compounds in tissues of subtropical and tropical marine organisms. The search was limited to reports of analyte concentrations in whole body or muscle tissue that were minimally determined by chromatographic procedures. A total of 1564 sample analyses consisting of 4431 analyte determinations were obtained for hard and soft corals, sponges, benthic seagrasses and algae, gastropods, fish and shellfish, and‘market-basket' (processed seafood) samples. For comparative purposes, data that were reported on a wet-or fresh-weight basis were uniformly converted to a common dry-weight estimate by dividing the wet-weight values by five (i.e., 80% water, 20% dry-weight tissue). Due to the large variation in analytical procedures, target analytes, chromatographic interpretations, and reporting units, the data were pooled by organochlorine-compound class (i.e., chlorinated cyclodienes, chlorinated aliphatics, chlorinated phenols, and chlorinated terpenes, hexachlorocyclohexanes, and polychlorinated biphenyls). A meta-analysis of the resulting database yielded a mean analyte concentration of 1594 ± 8768 ng g−1(dry weight), a median concentration of 23 ng g−1(dry weight), and a mean of 2.89 analytes per sample; the corresponding mean tissue burden is 4608 ng g−1(dry weight), the equivalent of 922 ng g−1on a wet-weight basis. It was also found that the chlorinated aliphatics (i.e., DDT and its metabolites) constituted 40.15% of the reported analyte determinations. © 1999, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},
